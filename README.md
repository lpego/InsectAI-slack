Instructions and guidelines for the COST action InsectAI's Slack channel. 

For comprehensive documentation take a look at the [Slack help pages](https://slack.com/help), this is just a quick guide on how to get going. 

## How to join the Slack workspace

Slack's sing-up is bit unusual, because it doesn't involve a classic username & password combination. 

From the invitation email, click "Join workspace". If you don't have an account, you'll be prompted to create one. 
You won't need to enter the password every time you log in to Slack, but you will need it if you want to log in to the workspace on anotehr device (i.e. your phone or a new laptop). 

Once you're logged in you can either see the workspace via browser (e.g. Firefox, Chrome), or install the [Slack app](https://slack.com/downloads). 

## Guidelines for preserving information
Slack's free version does not show messages older than 90 days, or over 10'000 per channel (see [here](https://slack.com/pricing/free)). 
This means that useful conversations and resources can get lost if left in the channel too long. 

One way to circumvent this is to save important information in standalone online documents, like Google Docs or Google Sheets.

It's crucial that members recognize and take action when something is of enduring value, and transfer those contents to a separate document. 
Anyone can create a Google Doc and transfer the important info there, then its ownership can be transferred to InsectAI's Google Account for safekeeping and managing sharing permissions centrally, se following sections. 

## How to enable Google Drive integration in Slack
Slack has integrations for Google Drive that make it easier to manage sharing permissions and monitor comments directly in Slack.
